# Accelerated-Federated-Learning
## Problem Statement
Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning setting where many clients (e.g. mobile devices or whole organizations) collaboratively train a model under the orchestration of a central server (e.g. service provider), while keeping the training data decentralized [1], which mitigats the data isolation and protects the data
privacy. In
